Script Title
The text encryptor is a python mini project that allows the user to encrypt or decrypt any tet they wish using the ceaser cipher... With no GUI, it may not be the most intuitive, but I would like if someone could contribute and make a gui for this application in the future...

Prerequisites
Do not worry... there are no modules that are needed to run the project... just python itself...
